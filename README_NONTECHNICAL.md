# 🎄 **The Garrett Couples Challenge** 🎄  

## **A Gift to Us**  

Life can get busy. Between work, errands, and everyday responsibilities, it's easy to lose focus on what truly matters: **us**.

This Christmas, I want to give us something special — a way to reconnect, laugh, and love intentionally every day.

## **What is the Garrett Couples Challenge?**  

The *Garrett Couples Challenge* is a daily reminder to cherish and strengthen our relationship. Each day, for 30 days, all months of the year, we’ll get a simple, thoughtful activity designed to bring us closer.  

These prompts will encourage us to:  
❤️ Show love in small but meaningful ways.  
🗣 Improve how we communicate and listen to each other.  
💬 Spark deeper conversations and rediscover what makes us “us.”  

---

## **How It Works**  

Every morning, a new prompt will arrive, encouraging us to take **just a few minutes** for each other. These activities are designed to be:  

✨ **Quick**: 1–5 minutes of our day — even on the busiest days.  
🎁 **Thoughtful**: Small gestures and questions that make a big impact.  
💖 **Meaningful**: Focused on appreciation, connection, and fun.  

---

## **Daily Activities You'll Love**  

The prompts fall into three categories to keep things fresh and exciting:  

- **💌 Love Deposits**:  
   Small, playful gestures to express love and gratitude.  
   *“Give your partner a surprise hug.”*  

- **🗣 Communication Tips**:  
   Simple suggestions to help us listen better and talk more kindly.  
   *“Take a pause after your partner speaks — no interrupting!”*  

- **💬 Conversation Starters**:  
   Thoughtful questions that spark deeper discussions.  
   *“What’s a memory from our first date that still makes you smile?”*

## **Why I Chose This Gift**  

Because you’re my favorite person.  ;)
Because I want us to keep growing, laughing, and loving.  
Because you deserve to feel cherished and connected — every day.  

---

## **What to Expect**  

Starting tomorrow, we’ll have:  
📅 **One small daily activity** to focus on each other.  
💬 A chance to share thoughts, laughter, and love.  
💖 A stronger, closer connection.  

It’s not about grand gestures or big changes — it’s about finding **magic in the little moments** and prioritizing **us** every single day.

---

## **The Challenge Starts... Together**  

We’ll take this one day at a time, and I promise to be as committed as you are. Let’s make the next 30 days (and beyond) full of love, fun, and connection.  

Merry Christmas, my love. This is for us. 🎄❤️
